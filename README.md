# Exercises for Full stack web development Tutorial Course
This repository is where you can find some really easy samples for the mentioned videos.

## Summary

In this section, the instructor taught some basic concept of Javascript language and made a easy percentage calculator for practice. Based on that, I have created a questionaire where you can fill in information and then reflect it on the paragraph below. (This is mostly about how to extract data from html input and replace it with desired value in return.)
