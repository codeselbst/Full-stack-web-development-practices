# Exercises for Full stack web development Tutorial Course
This repository is where you can find some really easy samples for the mentioned videos.

## Summary

The final part of HIML introduction guides us through how to make a easy but responsive webpage. It contains four parts, header, nav, body, and footer. In header part, a dorpdownlist is added when the page is loaded in mobile phones. In nav part, two forms are created for users to fill in their username and password (without any authentication functions). Moreover, in body part, three blocks are made above the footer part where most of the time you can find the further information about the websites. 
The whole structure is identical to what you can see in the videos; however, I have duplicated it and adjusted a bit in order to see the difference when you connect to them. The duplicated webpages are "News", "Contact", and "About" pages.
Lastly, the handylink file consists some helpful links you may need during the webpage coding.
