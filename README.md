# Exercises for Full stack web development Tutorial Course
This repository is where you can find some really easy samples for the mentioned videos.

## Summary
This time, I used SASS as a compile tool to make styles more organized. The project follows the structure of SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS ). That is, the project is divided into different part. 

* Base ➡ html. body, form
* Layouts➡ header, footer
* Modules➡ navbar, button, images

## Outcome

The theme is "ONE PIECE", one of the most well-known animations from Japan!
